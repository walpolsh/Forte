# Forté - Scale Encyclopedia

> _This application began as way for me to learn more about web developement and programming but quickly evolved into a tool that combined my knowledge of music with this path I've been taking into the world of CS. I hope this is useful from an educational standpoint and helps demonstrates a few of my skills as a programmer. - Paul_
